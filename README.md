This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

tweet sweep is a simple web app where you type in a keyword that you're looking for tweets about.
the web-app will give you upto the 1000 most recent tweets with that keyword featured, and sort them by interaction (highest number of rts + favs at the top). it may take a few seconds as i am filtering duplicate tweets (tweets that have been RT'd by multiple users) and replacing those, so sit tight while the good stuff comes in.

thanks for reading and that's it!
